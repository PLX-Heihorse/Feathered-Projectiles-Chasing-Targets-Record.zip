Game Description: Rabbit Rooster Shooter

Core Concept:​

A quirky arcade-style game where a rabbit shoots roosters from a cement pipe to hit moving targets. The player controls the rabbit's aim and timing to maximize score within a 60-second time limit.

Game Modes:​
Target Practice Mode:​

Shoot moving targets (e.g., bullseyes, moving plates) to earn points.
Targets vary in speed and size for increasing difficulty.

BOSS Mode:​
Face a giant boss (e.g., a mechanical fox or wolf) with weak points.
Dodge boss attacks while aiming roosters at its vulnerable zones.

Key Features:​
Aiming Mechanics:​ Adjust the cement pipe’s angle and power to launch roosters.

Dynamic Movement:​ Targets/BOSSes move unpredictably to challenge precision.

60-Second Rounds:​ Race against the clock to set high scores.

Scoring System:​ Points based on target difficulty (e.g., small/fast targets = higher points).

Sample Description for Store/Player:​
